Contributing to Silhouette
==========================

How to contribute
-----------------

Silhouette is an open source project. Contributions are appreciated.

Some ways in which you can contribute are: reporting errors, improving documentation, adding examples, adding support 
for more services, fixing bugs, suggesting new features, adding test cases, translating messages, and whatever else 
you can think of that may be helpful. If in doubt, just ask.


Development workflow
--------------------

Development is coordinated via [GitHub]. Ideas for improvements are discussed using the [chat] or the [mailing list].

To submit issues, please use the [GitHub issue tracker]. **Please do not use the issue tracker for questions!**

The documentation can be improved by submitting change requests via [readme.io].

For a more streamlined experience for all people involved, we encourage contributors to follow the practices described 
at [GitHub workflow for submitting pull requests].

Scala source code should follow the conventions documented in the [Scala Style Guide]. Additionally, acronyms should 
be capitalized. To have your code automatically reformatted, run this command before committing your changes:

    scripts/reformat

After submitting your pull request, please [watch the result] of the automated Travis CI build and correct any reported 
errors or inconsistencies.

By submitting work via pull requests, issues, documentation, or any other means, contributors indicate their agreement to 
publish their work under this project's license and also attest that they are the authors of the work and grant a
